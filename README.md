Answer to question- The flow is pretty hard to understand for the user since I used the built in vector assets such as the trash can for the delete function and the pencil for the edit function, so it is pretty easy to understnd how to operate the app.
The implementation is not very and needs to use another activity that pops whenever an edit button is pressed.
This flow is pretty consistent in all android apps I know.


# TodoItems List

An Android exercise for developers teaching how to play around with RecyclerView and Adapter

## Background:

In this project, we are creating a TODO list app.
The user can insert TodoItems, mark them as DONE or IN-PROGRESS, and delete them.

The exact SPECS can be found at file `MainActivity.java`.

*NOTICE:*
The app implementation is extracted into logic and UI:

Pure-logic should be implemented at `TodoItemsHolderImpl.java`.

UI should be implemented at `MainActivity.java`.  

## To fulfill this exercise:

Take a look at the following files, read all of them, and make sure you understand them before starting to write any code:
* `TodoItemsHolder.java` (interface)
* `TodoItemsHolderImpl.java` (default implementation of the interface)
* `TodoItem` (data class representing a TODO item)
* `MainActivity.java` (screen)

After you understand them, go ahead and implement the needed SPECS as defined in `MainActivity`.

> 🛈 **NOTICE:** \
> You might need to modify classes, add fields, change methods etc etc.  
> Don't be afraid, it's completely ok to modify existing code.

## Tests:

*Logic tests:*
You are expected to add unit & flow tests to `TodoItemsHolderImplTest.java`.
Read the entire file and then implement the TODOs in that file. 

*UI tests:*
You are expected to add a few tests to `MainActivityTest.java`.
Read the entire file and then implement the TODOs in that file.

## Remarks:

Tests implementations should come *last*. Start with logic tests and then continue to UI tests. 
My request to write tests is only an added-value for you to sharp your testing skills.
If you see that the exercise takes too much time to implement even *without* writing the tests,
please **LET ME KNOW** and I will drop the request for tests from the exercise submission.

✨ Good luck! ✨
